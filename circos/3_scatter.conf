#type - determines the type of plot and can be one of scatter, line, histogram, heatmap, etc. 
#file - file that contains plot data 
#min/max - the range of the plot axis, data outside this range are clipped 
#r0/r1 - the inner and outer radius of the plot track, which may be formatted in absolute or relative (or mix) form, just like for highlights 
#glyph - shape of glyph to use for the scatter plot and can be one of circle, rectangle, or triangle 
#glyph_size - size of the glyph, in pixels 
#color - if used, the the glyph will be solid and of this color 
#stroke_color - if used, the glyph will have an outline of this color
